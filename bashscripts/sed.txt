SED

stands for 'stream editor'


> sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT]  [INPUTFILE...]

OPTIONS is a regular expression 

it is proceeded by s for a substitution.

just like :s in vim

By default the 's' flag will replace the first occurence in a line 
Not subsequent matches in a line.

But it is performed globally

To work on all occurences in a line we have to append the 'g' flag 

one one one two
one one one two
one one one two
one one one two
one one one two
